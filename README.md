This repository will be updated over time and is still in development but I'd be happy if you would ⭐ this repository!

## 📖 Background

> This repository is a small collection of my Arduino ESP32 sketches written with the Arduino IDE. I plan on moving forward to pure C and C++ someday. You can use the sketches however you want but if you spot any errors or improvement recommendations, don't hesitate to create a pullrequest or an issue! Thank you very much!
